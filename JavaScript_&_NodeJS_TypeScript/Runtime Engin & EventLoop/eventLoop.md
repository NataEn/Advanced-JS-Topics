# JavaScript Runtime Engin and the Event Loop

Javascript is a single threaded rune-time environment. This means that it has only one call stack. Means- one line of code runs at a time.

Here is a good schema to illustrate how the JS engin works:
![alt text](./event_loop2.png)
The v8 **runtime** engin does not include the setTimeout, Dom, Http requests, and WebAPIs.These are dealt differently.

All together we have: Heep, Call-Stack, WebAPIs, and the event-loop. Lets review each one:

- Heep- where memory allocation appends

## Call Stack

call stack- where stack frames are. This records where in the program we are located. As JS is single threaded, there is only **one call stack**. One piece of code runs at a time.
This is a data structure of a **stack**, if we step into a function, it is added to the stack, if we return from a function,it is removed from the stack.

Examples of tasks:

1. When an external script `<script src="...">` loads, the task is to execute it.
2. When a user moves their mouse, the task is to dispatch mousemove event and execute handlers.
3. When the time is due for a scheduled setTimeout, the task is to run its callback.
4. and so on.

Tasks are set ‚Äì the engine handles them ‚Äì then waits for more tasks (while sleeping and consuming close to zero CPU).
For instance, lets run the next code:

```
function firstFunc(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
function secondFunc(n){
    return firstFunc(n,n);
}
function thirdFunc(n){
    const sum=secondFunc(n)
   console.log(sum);
}
thirdFunc(2)

```

In the stack: (we can see it upside down)
file name added to the stack: main(), and some declarations and definitions are parsed (the hoisting is happening...)<br/>
ü°ª<br/>
the first function execution is added: thirdFunc(2)
ü°ª<br/>
calling the second function: secondFunc(n)<br/>
ü°ª<br/>
calling the first function: firstFunc(n,n)<br/>
ü°£ here we start returning the values and those functions a popped from the stack:<br/>
ü°ª<br/>
first function is popped<br/>
ü°ª<br/>
second function is popped<br/>
ü°ª<br/>
console.log() is **added to the stack** <br/>
ü°ª<br/>
console.log() popped from the stack <br/>
ü°ª<br/>
third function does not return anything so we are done <br/>
ü°ª<br/> call stack is empty

## Blocking code

As there is only one call stack, every code blocks the next code line from happening. When it takes time for the code to finish, that we experience a problem, the app is slow.
The code runs in browsers, we cannot open another thread to execute complex code separately. When code is blocking other user events cannot happen at the same time- for instance while there is an AJAX request we cannot continue clicking buttons at the same time. The whole site is stuck until all requests resolved. <br/>
Solution: async callbacks --How does they work with regard to the call stack?

for instance, lets run the next code:

```
console.log('hi');

setTimeOut(function(){
    console.log("there");
},5000);

console.log("end of code");
```

In the stack: (we can see it upside down)
file name added to the stack: main(), and some declarations and definitions are parsed (the hoisting is happening...)<br/>
ü°ª<br/>
console.log('hi')- added <br/>
ü°ª<br/>
console.log('hi')- removed<br/>
ü°ª<br/>
setTimeOut(cb,5000)- added: **access point of WebAPIs**<br/>
ü°ª<br/>
setTimeOut(cb,5000)- disappears : **WebAPI works on the timer**<br/>
ü°ª<br/>
console.log("end of code") -popped<br/>
ü°ª<br/> call stack is empty<br/>
ü°ª<br/> after 5 seconds
console.log("there");- added <br/>
ü°ª<br/>
console.log("there");- removed<br/>
ü°ª<br/> call stack is empty again<br/>

## The Event Loop

The interesting thing is that **the browser include more features than the Runtime**. These are the WebAPIs. (look at the above illustration again). They do not act exactly like threads because we can just make calls to them. These areas where concurrency happens. <br/>
_--> in node it looks the same only instead of web apis it has C++ apis. All threads are run in the C++ end and are not available._ <br/>

Each WebAPI-task is passed to the callback queue. Tasks from the queue are processed on ‚Äúfirst come ‚Äì first served‚Äù basis.

Now lets see how does the prev code acts in the WebAPIs:

- SetTimeOut is an API provided by the browser. It is not part of the V8 source code.

Inside the WebAPI:
ü°ª<br/> timer for 5000 ms starts running and being handled<br/>
_the SetTimeOut is removed from the call-stack because it is handled by the WebAPI._ <br/>
ü°ª _the call stack is done by now_<br/>
ü°ª timer finished in WebAPI <br/>

_moving on to the **task queue**_ <br/>
ü°ª <br/>
**callback function** inside the setTimeOut is added to the **task queue**
ü°ª <br/>
Here the event loop (that is always working) relevant: <br/>
The event loop looks at the call-stack and the task-queue. If stack is empty- first element on the queue is pushed to the stack and being executed.<br/>

When we render css, it's rendering process is also queued to enter the call stack, separately from the callback queue. Similarly to the callback queue, it is entered to the stack by the event loop and thus is waiting for the call-stack to empty, so it can render the dom according to the new css roles. <br/>
**the css rendering is given a higher priority than the callbacks in the callback-queue**

- WebAPIs-extra things that the browser provides. like: DOM, AJAX,timeout etc...

- callback queue-

## Event Loop- More Facts

- The environment manages multiple concurrent event loops, to handle API calls for example. Web Workers run in their own event loop as well.
- The JavaScript engine does nothing most of the time, it only runs if a script/handler/event activates.
