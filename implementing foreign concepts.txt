1) keywoard and named arguments in JS
In JS, when invoking a function, the arguments should be added in their defined order:
func()
{//some code goes here}
in order to send the arguments to the function not in an ordered way, then send the function an object, when the object is recieved,
the object content will be desructered in another object;
